# Welcome to PoopMcRib's Background Checker

First, install Python. Instructions for installing python can be found on YouTube. I recommend downloading Pythong 3.11 from the Microsoft Store as it's the easiest way to install it.

Once Python is installed and you've restarted your computer, open command prompt and type the following:

"pip install requests"

Once you've installed the requests package, the program should be ready for use. Double click the program to run and enter the individuals username you wish to perform a background check on.

The program will take a minute or two to parse through every single board I've pre-written into the code so be patient. Once it has finished its search, open the text file created by the bot and individually check each card. Make sure you are also manually checking Google spreadsheets, as not all departments keep everything on Trello.

If you encounter any issues, reach out to PropMcRib and I'll try to help you as best I can.
